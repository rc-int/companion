/**
 * Service Worker registration for production builds.
 *
 * Uses vite-plugin-pwa's autoUpdate mode: when a new SW is detected,
 * it downloads, installs, and activates immediately (skipWaiting + clientsClaim).
 *
 * In dev mode the virtual:pwa-register module is a no-op, so importing
 * this file has no effect during development.
 *
 * Edge cases:
 * - Multiple tabs: skipWaiting activates the new SW across all tabs immediately.
 *   WebSocket connections are unaffected (SW never intercepts /ws/* routes).
 * - First-time visitors: app loads from network; SW installs in background.
 * - SW update during active session: only static assets are cached. API calls
 *   and WebSocket connections go directly to network.
