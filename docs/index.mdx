# The Companion

A browser-based interface for running multiple [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) and [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) sessions with streaming output, tool call visibility, and permission control.

## Quick start

```bash
bunx the-companion
```

Open [http://localhost:3456](http://localhost:3456). See the [Installation](/getting-started/installation) guide for more options.

## Subscription and authentication

The Companion is a local UI layer that runs on your machine. It does not have its own account system or billing.

- **Claude Code** requires an Anthropic API key or a Claude Pro/Team/Enterprise subscription with Claude Code enabled.
- **Codex** requires an OpenAI account with Codex CLI access.

All model inference happens through your own subscriptions. The Companion bridges your browser to these CLI tools over a local WebSocket connection.
