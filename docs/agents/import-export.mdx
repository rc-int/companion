# Import & Export

## Export an agent

1. On the **Agents** page, find the agent you want to export
2. Click the **download icon** on the agent card
3. A `.agent.json` file is downloaded to your machine

The exported file contains the agent's full configuration: name, description, prompt, backend settings, triggers, MCP servers, environment variables, and more.

Tracking fields (ID, creation date, run count, etc.) are excluded from the export so the agent starts fresh when imported.

## Import an agent

1. On the **Agents** page, click **Import**
2. Select a `.agent.json` file
3. The agent is created in a **disabled** state for safety — review its configuration before enabling it

<Warning>
Imported agents start disabled. Review the agent's prompt, environment variables, and permissions before enabling it, especially if the file came from an external source.
</Warning>
