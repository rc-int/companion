# Quickstart

## Prerequisites

Install [Bun](https://bun.sh) and at least one agent CLI:

```bash
# Bun
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash

# Claude Code
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# Codex (optional)
npm install -g @openai/codex
```

Make sure your CLI is authenticated before proceeding (run `claude` or `codex` once in your terminal to set up credentials).

## 1. Start the server

```bash
bunx the-companion
```

Open [http://localhost:3456](http://localhost:3456).

## 2. Create a session

Click **New Session** on the home page. Choose:

- **Backend**: Claude Code or Codex
- **Working directory**: The project folder the agent will operate in
- **Model** (Claude Code): Which Claude model to use
- **Branch** (optional): Select or create a git branch
- **Environment** (optional): Apply an [environment profile](/environments/environment-profiles)

Click **Start** to launch the session.

## 3. Chat with the agent

Type a prompt in the composer and press Enter. You'll see:

- **Streaming responses** as the agent thinks
- **Tool call blocks** showing each action (file reads, writes, bash commands)
- **Task items** extracted from the agent's work plan

## 4. Handle permissions

When the agent wants to write a file or run a command, a permission banner appears:

<img src="/screenshots/readme-permissions.png" alt="Permission approval UI" />

- **Allow**: Execute this tool call
- **Deny**: Skip this action
- **Allow all**: Auto-approve for the rest of the session

See [Permissions](/sessions/permissions) for more control options.

- [Build agents](/agents/creating-agents) for automated workflows
- [Set up Docker environments](/environments/docker-sessions) for isolated sessions
- [Connect Linear](/integrations/linear) for issue-driven development
