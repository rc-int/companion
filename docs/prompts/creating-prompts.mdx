# Creating Prompts

Saved prompts let you store reusable instructions that can be inserted into any session. Navigate to **Prompts** in the sidebar (or go to `#/prompts`).

## Create a prompt

1. Click **New Prompt**
2. Enter a **name** (e.g., `review-pr`, `fix-tests`, `explain-code`)
3. Write the **prompt content** — the actual instructions the agent will receive
4. Choose a **scope**:
   - **Global**: Available in all sessions regardless of working directory
   - **Project**: Only appears in sessions whose working directory matches one of the associated folders
5. For project-scoped prompts, click **Add Folder** to associate one or more project paths
6. Click **Save**

## Edit and delete

- Click the **pencil icon** on any prompt card to edit its name, content, scope, or associated folders
- Click the **trash icon** to delete a prompt
- Use the **search bar** at the top to filter prompts by name or content

## Scope: global vs project

| Scope | Visible in | Use case |
|---|---|---|
| Global | All sessions | General instructions like "review this PR" or "explain this code" |
| Project | Sessions whose cwd matches an associated folder | Project-specific instructions like "use our ESLint config" or "follow our API conventions" |

A single prompt can be associated with multiple project folders. For example, a "run tests" prompt could be linked to both your frontend and backend repos with different test commands.

## Grouped view

The Prompts page groups prompts by scope:

- **Global** section at the top with all global prompts
- **Per-folder** sections below, one for each unique project path

## Storage

Prompts are stored at `~/.companion/prompts.json` as a JSON array. Each prompt has a unique ID, name, content, scope, and timestamps.

## REST API
