# Using Prompts

Once you've [created prompts](/prompts/creating-prompts), you can insert them into any session using the `@` mention syntax.

## How to use

1. Open a session and click in the **composer** (message input)
2. Type `@` followed by the prompt name (e.g., `@review-pr`)
3. A **mention menu** appears with matching prompts
4. Select the prompt — its content is inserted inline into your message
5. Press Enter to send

## How filtering works

- The mention menu shows prompts matching your text using fuzzy search on the prompt title
- **Global prompts** always appear
- **Project-scoped prompts** only appear when the session's working directory matches one of the prompt's associated folders

## Example workflow

### 1. Create a "review-pr" prompt

Go to **Prompts** and create:

- **Name**: `review-pr`
- **Content**: `Review this pull request. Check for bugs, security issues, and code style. Suggest improvements. Run the test suite and report any failures.`
- **Scope**: Global

### 2. Use it in a session

Open a session in your project directory and type:

```
@review-pr
```

The composer expands to:

```
Review this pull request. Check for bugs, security issues, and code style.
Suggest improvements. Run the test suite and report any failures.
```

You can add extra context before sending:

```
@review-pr Focus especially on the authentication changes in auth.ts.
```

### 3. Project-specific variant

Create another prompt scoped to your backend project:

- **Name**: `review-pr`
- **Content**: `Review this pull request. Run "bun run test" and "bun run typecheck". Check that all API routes have input validation. Ensure SQL queries use parameterized statements.`
- **Scope**: Project (`/home/user/backend`)

When you're in a session with cwd `/home/user/backend`, the project-scoped version appears first in the mention menu. In other sessions, only the global version appears.
