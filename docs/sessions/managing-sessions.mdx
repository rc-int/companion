# Managing Sessions

## Sidebar

The sidebar lists all active and recent sessions. Each entry shows the session name, backend type, connection status, and working directory. Click a session to switch to it.

## Chat view

The chat view displays messages in a timeline:

- **User messages**: Your prompts
- **Assistant messages**: Streaming agent responses
- **Tool call blocks**: Expandable blocks showing the tool name, input, and output
- **Permission banners**: Inline approve/deny buttons for sensitive actions

## Task panel

The right-side panel shows a structured breakdown of the agent's work. Tasks are automatically extracted from `TodoWrite`, `TaskCreate`, and `TaskUpdate` tool calls. Each task shows its status: pending, in progress, or completed.

## Interrupting the agent

Click the **stop button** in the composer area to interrupt a running agent. This sends an interrupt signal to the CLI subprocess.

## Archiving sessions

Remove sessions from the sidebar by archiving them. This:

- Stops the CLI subprocess
- Removes the session file from disk
- If a Docker container is running, removes the container and its volume
- If a [Linear issue](/integrations/linear) is linked, prompts you to choose what happens to the issue status

<Warning>
Archiving a Docker session removes the container and all uncommitted changes inside it. Make sure you've committed or pushed any work before archiving.
</Warning>

## Session tabs

Sessions may have additional tabs beyond the chat:

| Tab | Description |
|---|---|
| **Chat** | Main conversation view |
| **Diff** | File changes made during the session |
| **Editor** | In-app code editor (CodeMirror) |
| **Terminal** | Terminal access to the session's environment |
| **Process** | Raw CLI process output |
